Agassiz's perspective on science combined observation with intuition and the assumption that a person can grasp the \"divine plan\" in all phenomena. When it came to explaining life-forms, Agassiz resorted to matters of shape based on a presumed archetype for his evidence. This dual view of knowledge was in concert with the teachings of Common Sense Realism derived from Scottish philosophers Thomas Reid and Dugald Stewart, whose works were part of the Harvard curriculum at the time. The popularity of Agassiz's efforts to \"soar with Plato\" probably also derived from other writings to which Harvard students were exposed, including Platonic treatises by Ralph Cudworth, John Norrisand, in a Romantic vein, Samuel Coleridge.

But the stadium was too narrow to accommodate a wider playing surface. So, other steps had to be taken. Camp would instead support revolutionary new rules for the 1906 season.

Research at United Nations University reports that the richest 1% of adults alone owned 40% of global assets in the year 2000. The three richest people in the world possess more financial assets than the lowest 48 nations combined. The combined wealth of the \"10 million dollar millionaires\" grew to nearly $41 trillion in 2008. A January 2014 report by Oxfam claims that the 85 wealthiest individuals in the world have a combined wealth equal to that of the bottom 50% of the world's population, or about 3.5 billion people. According to a Los Angeles Times analysis of the report, the wealthiest 1% owns 46% of the world's wealth; the 85 richest people, a small part of the wealthiest 1%, own about 0.7% of the human population's wealth, which is the same as the bottom half of the population. More recently, in January 2015, Oxfam reported that the wealthiest 1 percent will own more than half of the global wealth by 2016. An October 2014 study by Credit Suisse also claims that the top 1% now own nearly half of the world's wealth and that the accelerating disparity could trigger a recession. In October 2015, Credit Suisse published a study which shows global inequality continues to increase, and that half of the world's wealth is now in the hands of those in the top percentile, whose assets each exceed $759,900. A 2016 report by Oxfam claims that the 62 wealthiest individuals own as much wealth as the poorer half of the global population combined. Oxfam's claims have however been questioned on the basis of the methodology used: by using net wealth (adding up assets and subtracting debts), the Oxfam report, for instance, finds that there are more poor people in the United States and Western Europe than in China (due to a greater tendency to take on debts).[unreliable source?][unreliable source?] Anthony Shorrocks, the lead author of the Credit Suisse report which is one of the sources of Oxfam's data, considers the criticism about debt to be a \"silly argument\" and \"a non-issue . . . a diversion.\""}, {"qas": [{"question": "How many Americans are richer than more than half of all citizens?", "id": "5727e8424b864d1900163fc0", "answers": [{"text": "400", "answer_start": 32}, {"text": "400", "answer_start": 32}, {"text": "400", "answer_start": 32}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What publication printed that the wealthiest 1% have more money than those in the bottom 90%?", "id": "5727e8424b864d1900163fc1", "answers": [{"text": "New York Times", "answer_start": 127}, {"text": "New York Times", "answer_start": 127}, {"text": "New York Times", "answer_start": 127}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is considered as a potential advantage for wealth for some Americans?", "id": "5727e8424b864d1900163fc2", "answers": [{"text": "Inherited wealth", "answer_start": 253}, {"text": "Inherited wealth", "answer_start": 253}, {"text": "Inherited wealth", "answer_start": 253}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What did the richest 400 Americans have as children that helped them be successful adults?", "id": "5727e8424b864d1900163fc3", "answers": [{"text": "grew up in substantial privilege", "answer_start": 489}, {"text": "substantial privilege", "answer_start": 500}, {"text": "substantial privilege", "answer_start": 500}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do the top 400 richest Americans have more of than half of all Americans combined?", "id": "5729d44b1d04691400779611", "answers": [{"text": "wealth", "answer_start": 65}, {"text": "wealth", "answer_start": 65}, {"text": "wealth", "answer_start": 65}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who owns more wealth than the bottom 90 percent of people in the U.S.?", "id": "5729d44b1d04691400779612", "answers": [{"text": "richest 1 percent", "answer_start": 165}, {"text": "richest 1 percent", "answer_start": 165}, {"text": "richest 1 percent", "answer_start": 165}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What may explain why some Americans who've become rich may have had a head start?", "id": "5729d44b1d04691400779613", "answers": [{"text": "Inherited wealth", "answer_start": 253}, {"text": "Inherited wealth", "answer_start": 253}, {"text": "Inherited wealth", "answer_start": 253}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many of the richest 400 Americans grew up in substantial privilege?", "id": "5729d44b1d04691400779614", "answers": [{"text": "over 60 percent", "answer_start": 435}, {"text": "over 60 percent", "answer_start": 435}, {"text": "over 60 percent", "answer_start": 435}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What Institute published findings in September 2012 regarding the Forbes richest 400 Americans?", "id": "5729d44b1d04691400779615", "answers": [{"text": "Institute for Policy Studies", "answer_start": 404}, {"text": "Institute for Policy Studies", "answer_start": 404}, {"text": "PolitiFact", "answer_start": 13}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "400", "answer_start": 32}], "question": "How many Americans are richer than less than half of all citizens?", "id": "5ad2434fd7d075001a4289d6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "New York Times", "answer_start": 127}], "question": "What publication printed that the wealthiest 1% have more money than those in the bottom 99%?", "id": "5ad2434fd7d075001a4289d7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Inherited wealth", "answer_start": 253}], "question": "What is considered as a potential disadvantage for wealth for some Americans?", "id": "5ad2434fd7d075001a4289d8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "grew up in substantial privilege", "answer_start": 489}], "question": "What did the richest 40 Americans have as children that helped them be successful adults?", "id": "5ad2434fd7d075001a4289d9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "wealth", "answer_start": 65}], "question": "What do the top 400 richest Americans have less of than half of all Americans combined?", "id": "5ad2434fd7d075001a4289da", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "According to PolitiFact the top 400 richest Americans \"have more wealth than half of all Americans combined.\" According to the New York Times on July 22, 2014, the \"richest 1 percent in the United States now own more wealth than the bottom 90 percent\".

The difference between the Gini index for an income distribution before taxation and the Gini index after taxation is an indicator for the effects of such taxation."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is key to getting the skills needed for high demand jobs?", "id": "5727f05b4b864d1900164068", "answers": [{"text": "access to education", "answer_start": 79}, {"text": "Education", "answer_start": 100}, {"text": "education", "answer_start": 214}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What do people with lower income have less access to?", "id": "5727f05b4b864d1900164069", "answers": [{"text": "optional education", "answer_start": 409}, {"text": "education", "answer_start": 374}, {"text": "education", "answer_start": 374}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does less education lead to when working?", "id": "5727f05b4b864d190016406a", "answers": [{"text": "lower wages", "answer_start": 452}, {"text": "lower wages", "answer_start": 452}, {"text": "lower wages", "answer_start": 452}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who has limited productive potential when faced with less access to education?", "id": "5727f05b4b864d190016406b", "answers": [{"text": "poor", "answer_start": 719}, {"text": "poor", "answer_start": 719}, {"text": "poor", "answer_start": 719}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What are those with lower incomes less likely to have in order to prepare for the future?", "id": "5727f05b4b864d190016406c", "answers": [{"text": "savings and investment", "answer_start": 578}, {"text": "education,", "answer_start": 374}, {"text": "education", "answer_start": 418}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an important factor contributing to inequality for individuals?", "id": "5729e1101d04691400779641", "answers": [{"text": "access to education", "answer_start": 79}, {"text": "access to education", "answer_start": 79}, {"text": "access to education", "answer_start": 79}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does education in an area where there is high demand for workers tend to create?", "id": "5729e1101d04691400779642", "answers": [{"text": "high wages", "answer_start": 183}, {"text": "high wages", "answer_start": 183}, {"text": "high wages", "answer_start": 183}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What type of wages do people unable to afford an education receive?", "id": "5729e1101d04691400779643", "answers": [{"text": "lower", "answer_start": 452}, {"text": "lower wages", "answer_start": 452}, {"text": "lower wages", "answer_start": 452}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does lack of education lead directly to?", "id": "5729e1101d04691400779644", "answers": [{"text": "lower incomes", "answer_start": 538}, {"text": "lower incomes", "answer_start": 538}, {"text": "lower incomes", "answer_start": 538}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What helps to unleash the productivity ability of the poor?", "id": "5729e1101d04691400779645", "answers": [{"text": "education", "answer_start": 614}, {"text": "education", "answer_start": 614}, {"text": "education", "answer_start": 614}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "access to education", "answer_start": 79}], "question": "What is key to getting the skills needed for low demand jobs?", "id": "5ad24840d7d075001a428b5c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "optional education", "answer_start": 409}], "question": "What do people with higher income have less access to?", "id": "5ad24840d7d075001a428b5d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "lower wages", "answer_start": 452}], "question": "What does more education lead to when working?", "id": "5ad24840d7d075001a428b5e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "poor", "answer_start": 719}], "question": "Who has limited productive potential when faced with more access to education?", "id": "5ad24840d7d075001a428b5f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "savings and investment", "answer_start": 578}], "question": "What are those with lower incomes more likely to have in order to prepare for the future?", "id": "5ad24840d7d075001a428b60", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "An important factor in the creation of inequality is variation in individuals' access to education.

In fact, it differs from the present high school education, which is regarded as a stepping-stone to acquire college and advanced degrees. This decrease in wages caused a period of compression and decreased inequality between skilled and unskilled workers. Education is very important for the growth of the economy, however educational inequality in gender also influence towards the economy. Lagerlof and Galor stated that gender inequality in education can result to low economic growth, and continued gender inequality in education, thus creating a poverty trap.

He attributes this trend to increased trade with poor countries and the fragmentation of the means of production, resulting in low skilled jobs becoming more tradeable. However, he concedes that the effect of trade on inequality in America is minor when compared to other causes, such as technological innovation, a view shared by other experts. Empirical economists Max Roser and Jesus Crespo-Cuaresma find support in the data that international trade is increasing income inequality. They empirically confirm the predictions of the Stolper\u2013Samuelson theorem regarding the effects of international trade on the distribution of incomes. Lawrence Katz estimates that trade has only accounted for 5-15% of rising income inequality. Robert Lawrence argues that technological innovation and automation has meant that low-skilled jobs have been replaced by machine labor in wealthier nations, and that wealthier countries no longer have significant numbers of low-skilled manufacturing workers that could be affected by competition from poor countries."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What is the income inequality gap between genders in Botswana?", "id": "5727fd123acd2414000df185", "answers": [{"text": "53%", "answer_start": 705}, {"text": "53%", "answer_start": 705}, {"text": "53%", "answer_start": 705}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the gender income inequality in Bahrain?", "id": "5727fd123acd2414000df186", "answers": [{"text": "-40%", "answer_start": 724}, {"text": "-40%", "answer_start": 724}, {"text": "-40%", "answer_start": 724}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is attributed to the income inequality in the United States?", "id": "5727fd123acd2414000df187", "answers": [{"text": "less willing to travel or relocate", "answer_start": 266}, {"text": "women not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy", "answer_start": 392}, {"text": "not taking jobs due to marriage or pregnancy", "answer_start": 398}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who does the wage gap between genders provide an advantage?", "id": "5727fd123acd2414000df188", "answers": [{"text": "males", "answer_start": 57}, {"text": "males", "answer_start": 57}, {"text": "males", "answer_start": 57}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In many countries, what kind of pay gap is there?", "id": "5729f1c13f37b319004785e7", "answers": [{"text": "Gender", "answer_start": 30}, {"text": "ranges from 53% in Botswana to -40% in Bahrain", "answer_start": 693}, {"text": "Gender", "answer_start": 30}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who does a gender pay gap tend to favor?", "id": "5729f1c13f37b319004785e8", "answers": [{"text": "males in the labor market", "answer_start": 57}, {"text": "males", "answer_start": 57}, {"text": "males", "answer_start": 57}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What gender is less willing to travel or relocate for work?", "id": "5729f1c13f37b319004785e9", "answers": [{"text": "women", "answer_start": 166}, {"text": "women", "answer_start": 166}, {"text": "women", "answer_start": 166}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who is the author of the book, \"Knowledge and Decisions\"?", "id": "5729f1c13f37b319004785ea", "answers": [{"text": "Thomas Sowell", "answer_start": 302}, {"text": "Thomas Sowell", "answer_start": 302}, {"text": "Thomas Sowell", "answer_start": 302}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does a U.S. census report state that even after other factors there still exists this between earnings of men and women?", "id": "5729f1c13f37b319004785eb", "answers": [{"text": "a difference", "answer_start": 611}, {"text": "difference", "answer_start": 613}, {"text": "difference in earnings", "answer_start": 613}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "53%", "answer_start": 705}], "question": "What isn't the income inequality gap between genders in Botswana?", "id": "5ad258f3d7d075001a428de4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "-40%", "answer_start": 724}], "question": "What isn't the gender income inequality in Bahrain?", "id": "5ad258f3d7d075001a428de5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "less willing to travel or relocate", "answer_start": 266}], "question": "What is attributed to the income inequality in the United Nations?", "id": "5ad258f3d7d075001a428de6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "males", "answer_start": 57}], "question": "Who does the wage gap between genders provide a disadvantage?", "id": "5ad258f3d7d075001a428de7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Gender", "answer_start": 30}], "question": "In many countries, what kind of pay gap isn't there?", "id": "5ad258f3d7d075001a428de8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In many countries, there is a Gender pay gap in favor of males in the labor market.

An additional dollar spent by a poor person will go to things providing a great deal of utility to that person, such as basic necessities like food, water, and healthcare; while, an additional dollar spent by a much richer person will very likely go to luxury items providing relatively less utility to that person. Thus, the marginal utility of wealth per person (\"the additional dollar\") decreases as a person becomes richer.

Other causes of extra-legal property are failures to notarize transaction documents or having documents notarized but failing to have them recorded with the official agency."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What do a number of researchers think a shortage of is caused in part by income inequality?", "id": "572a1c943f37b319004786e1", "answers": [{"text": "a shortage of affordable housing", "answer_start": 83}, {"text": "affordable housing", "answer_start": 97}, {"text": "affordable housing", "answer_start": 97}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What decreased in number between 1984 and 1991?", "id": "572a1c943f37b319004786e2", "answers": [{"text": "quality rental units", "answer_start": 236}, {"text": "quality rental units", "answer_start": 236}, {"text": "quality rental units", "answer_start": 236}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Why did the demand for rentals decrease?", "id": "572a1c943f37b319004786e3", "answers": [{"text": "demand for higher quality housing increased", "answer_start": 274}, {"text": "demand for higher quality housing increased", "answer_start": 274}, {"text": "demand for higher quality housing increased", "answer_start": 274}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What drove increased rental prices in East New York?", "id": "572a1c943f37b319004786e4", "answers": [{"text": "residents willing to pay higher market rate for housing", "answer_start": 470}, {"text": "gentrification of older neighbourhoods", "answer_start": 344}, {"text": "new residents willing to pay higher market rate", "answer_start": 466}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What combined with ricing prices to make it difficult or impossible for poor people to keep pace?", "id": "572a1c943f37b319004786e5", "answers": [{"text": "ad valorem property tax policy", "answer_start": 583}, {"text": "ad valorem property tax policy", "answer_start": 583}, {"text": "property tax policy", "answer_start": 594}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a shortage of affordable housing", "answer_start": 83}], "question": "What do a number of researchers think a shortage of isn't caused in part by income inequality?", "id": "5ad266efd7d075001a4291f4", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "quality rental units", "answer_start": 236}], "question": "What decreased in number between 1948 and 1991?", "id": "5ad266efd7d075001a4291f5", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "demand for higher quality housing increased", "answer_start": 274}], "question": "Why did the demand for rentals increase?", "id": "5ad266efd7d075001a4291f6", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "residents willing to pay higher market rate", "answer_start": 470}], "question": "What drove decreased rental prices in East New York?", "id": "5ad266efd7d075001a4291f7", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ad valorem property tax policy", "answer_start": 583}], "question": "What combined with lowering prices to make it difficult or impossible for poor people to keep pace?", "id": "5ad266efd7d075001a4291f8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "A number of researchers (David Rodda, Jacob Vigdor, and Janna Matlack), argue that a shortage of affordable housing \u2013 at least in the US \u2013 is caused in part by income inequality.

Also note that the whole of the increase in environmental degradation is the result of the increase of emissions per person being multiplied by a multiplier. If there were fewer people however, this multiplier would be lower, and thus the amount of environmental degradation would be lower as well. As such, the current high level of population has a large impact on this as well.

Under the terms of the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost.

Thus, Zhenjin's third son, with the support of his mother K\u00f6kejin and the minister Bayan, succeeded the throne and ruled as Tem\u00fcr Khan, or Emperor Chengzong, from 1294 to 1307. Tem\u00fcr Khan decided to maintain and continue much of the work begun by his grandfather. He also made peace with the western Mongol khanates as well as neighboring countries such as Vietnam, which recognized his nominal suzerainty and paid tributes for a few decades.

The Chinese-style elements of the bureaucracy mainly came from the native Tang, Song, as well as Khitan Liao and Jurchen Jin dynasties. Chinese advisers such as Liu Bingzhong and Yao Shu gave strong influence to Kublai's early court, and the central government administration was established within the first decade of Kublai's reign.

In the area of Chinese painting during the Yuan dynasty there were many famous painters. In the area of calligraphy many of the great calligraphers were from the Yuan dynasty era. In Yuan poetry, the main development was the qu, which was used among other poetic forms by most of the famous Yuan poets. Many of the poets were also involved in the major developments in the theater during this time, and the other way around, with people important in the theater becoming famous through the development of the sanqu type of qu. One of the key factors in the mix of the zaju variety show was the incorporation of poetry both classical and of the newer qu form. One of the important cultural developments during the Yuan era was the consolidation of poetry, painting, and calligraphy into a unified piece of the type that tends to come to mind when people think of classical Chinese art. Another important aspect of Yuan times is the increasing incorporation of the then current, vernacular Chinese into both the qu form of poetry and the zaju variety show.

The top-level department and government agency known as the Bureau of Buddhist and Tibetan Affairs (Xuanzheng Yuan) was set up in Khanbaliq (modern Beijing) to supervise Buddhist monks throughout the empire. Since Kublai Khan only esteemed the Sakya sect of Tibetan Buddhism, other religions became less important. He and his successors kept a Sakya Imperial Preceptor (Dishi) at court. Before the end of the Yuan dynasty, 14 leaders of the Sakya sect had held the post of Imperial Preceptor, thereby enjoying special power. Furthermore, Mongol patronage of Buddhism resulted in a number of monuments of Buddhist art. Mongolian Buddhist translations, almost all from Tibetan originals, began on a large scale after 1300.

In the 18th century, Pierre-Louis Moreau de Maupertuis made experiments with scorpion venom and observed that certain dogs and mice were immune to this venom. This and other observations of acquired immunity were later exploited by Louis Pasteur in his development of vaccination and his proposed germ theory of disease. Pasteur's theory was in direct opposition to contemporary theories of disease, such as the miasma theory. It was not until Robert Koch's 1891 proofs, for which he was awarded a Nobel Prize in 1905, that microorganisms were confirmed as the cause of infectious disease.

As with B cells, each type of T cell recognizes a different antigen. Killer T cells are activated when their T cell receptor (TCR) binds to this specific antigen in a complex with the MHC Class I receptor of another cell. Recognition of this MHC:antigen complex is aided by a co-receptor on the T cell, called CD8. The T cell then travels throughout the body in search of cells where the MHC I receptors bear this antigen. When an activated T cell contacts such cells, it releases cytotoxins, such as perforin, which form pores in the target cell's plasma membrane, allowing ions, water and toxins to enter. The entry of another toxin called granulysin (a protease) induces the target cell to undergo apoptosis. T cell killing of host cells is particularly important in preventing the replication of viruses. T cell activation is tightly controlled and generally requires a very strong MHC/antigen activation signal, or additional activation signals provided by \"helper\" T cells (see below)."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What co-receptor recruits molecules inside the T cell that are responsible for cell activation?", "id": "5729f4b41d0469140077968b", "answers": [{"text": "CD4 co-receptor", "answer_start": 166}, {"text": "CD4", "answer_start": 166}, {"text": "CD4 co-receptor", "answer_start": 166}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How many receptors on a helper T cell must be bound to a MHC:antigen complex in order for the cell to be activated?", "id": "5729f4b41d0469140077968c", "answers": [{"text": "around 200\u2013300", "answer_start": 416}, {"text": "around 200\u2013300", "answer_start": 416}, {"text": "around 200\u2013300", "answer_start": 416}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The receptors on a killer T cell must bind to how many MHC: antigen complexes in order to activate the cell?", "id": "5729f4b41d0469140077968d", "answers": [{"text": "a single MHC:antigen molecule", "answer_start": 578}, {"text": "single", "answer_start": 580}, {"text": "a single MHC:antigen molecule", "answer_start": 578}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Activation of a helper T cell causes it to release what chemicals that influence cell activity?", "id": "5729f4b41d0469140077968e", "answers": [{"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 774}, {"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 774}, {"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 774}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is a ligand on the cell surface that is upregulated after helper T cell activation?", "id": "5729f4b41d0469140077968f", "answers": [{"text": "CD40 ligand", "answer_start": 1078}, {"text": "CD40", "answer_start": 1078}, {"text": "CD40 ligand", "answer_start": 1078}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules", "answer_start": 61}], "question": "What antigens do Helper T cells not recognize?", "id": "5ad4d2d65b96ef001a10a1f8", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Helper T cells", "answer_start": 288}], "question": "What has a stronger association with the MHC:antigen complex than killer T cells?", "id": "5ad4d2d65b96ef001a10a1f9", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "engagement of a single MHC:antigen molecule", "answer_start": 564}], "question": "What are killer T cells dis-activated by?", "id": "5ad4d2d65b96ef001a10a1fa", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 774}], "question": "What do helper T cells absorb?", "id": "5ad4d2d65b96ef001a10a1fb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "antibody", "answer_start": 1182}], "question": "What do B cells help T cells produce?", "id": "5ad4d2d65b96ef001a10a1fc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Helper T cells express T cell receptors (TCR) that recognize antigen bound to Class II MHC molecules.

With infectious disease remaining one of the leading causes of death in the human population, vaccination represents the most effective manipulation of the immune system mankind has developed."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Bacteria often secrete what kind of proteins to ingest a physical barrier?", "id": "572a019f3f37b31900478643", "answers": [{"text": "enzymes", "answer_start": 291}, {"text": "enzymes", "answer_start": 291}, {"text": "enzymes", "answer_start": 291}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What kind of system of infection involves inserting a hollow tube into a host cell?", "id": "572a019f3f37b31900478644", "answers": [{"text": "type III secretion system", "answer_start": 397}, {"text": "type III secretion system", "answer_start": 397}, {"text": "type III secretion system", "answer_start": 397}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "In a type III secretion system, proteins are transported to the host cell in order to do what?", "id": "572a019f3f37b31900478645", "answers": [{"text": "shut down host defenses", "answer_start": 584}, {"text": "shut down host defenses", "answer_start": 584}, {"text": "shut down host defenses.", "answer_start": 584}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "The success of pathogens is predicated on their ability to do what?", "id": "572a019f3f37b31900478646", "answers": [{"text": "elude host immune responses", "answer_start": 54}, {"text": "elude host immune responses", "answer_start": 54}, {"text": "ability to elude host immune responses", "answer_start": 43}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ability to elude host immune responses", "answer_start": 43}], "question": "What does the failure of a pathogen depend on?", "id": "5ad4f4405b96ef001a10a77e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "secreting enzymes that digest the barrier", "answer_start": 281}], "question": "How do viruses overcome physical barriers?", "id": "5ad4f4405b96ef001a10a77f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a hollow tube", "answer_start": 440}], "question": "What do bacteria use to move proteins from the host to the pathogen?", "id": "5ad4f4405b96ef001a10a780", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "enzymes", "answer_start": 291}], "question": "What are bacteria unable to secrete?", "id": "5ad4f4405b96ef001a10a781", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "proteins", "answer_start": 557}], "question": "What is used to shut down pathogen defenses?", "id": "5ad4f4405b96ef001a10a782", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The success of any pathogen depends on its ability to elude host immune responses.

Type II hypersensitivity occurs when antibodies bind to antigens on the patient's own cells, marking them for destruction. This is also called antibody-dependent (or cytotoxic) hypersensitivity, and is mediated by IgG and IgM antibodies. Immune complexes (aggregations of antigens, complement proteins, and IgG and IgM antibodies) deposited in various tissues trigger Type III hypersensitivity reactions. Type IV hypersensitivity (also known as cell-mediated or delayed type hypersensitivity) usually takes between two and three days to develop.

A third possible source of tumor antigens are proteins normally important for regulating cell growth and survival, that commonly mutate into cancer inducing molecules called oncogenes."}, {"qas": [{"question": "At what size and larger can drugs elicit a neutralizing immune response?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155222", "answers": [{"text": ">500 Da", "answer_start": 14}, {"text": ">500 Da", "answer_start": 14}, {"text": ">500 Da", "answer_start": 14}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What kind of amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155223", "answers": [{"text": "hydrophilic amino acids", "answer_start": 749}, {"text": "hydrophilic", "answer_start": 749}, {"text": "hydrophilic amino acids", "answer_start": 749}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the study of proteins involved in immune response known as?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155224", "answers": [{"text": "Immunoproteomics", "answer_start": 1257}, {"text": "Immunoproteomics", "answer_start": 1257}, {"text": "Immunoproteomics", "answer_start": 1257}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "There is a public database of epitopes for pathogens known to be recognizable by what cells?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155225", "answers": [{"text": "B cells", "answer_start": 1142}, {"text": "B", "answer_start": 1142}, {"text": "B cells", "answer_start": 1142}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is the field of studying immunogenicity through bioinformatics known as?", "id": "572a10cd6aef051400155226", "answers": [{"text": "immunoinformatics", "answer_start": 1238}, {"text": "immunoinformatics", "answer_start": 1238}, {"text": "immunoinformatics", "answer_start": 1238}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "neutralizing", "answer_start": 37}], "question": "What kind of immune response do smaller drugs provoke?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a758", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "limits the effectiveness", "answer_start": 147}], "question": "What does the neutralizing immune response mean for drugs based on smaller peptides and proteins?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a759", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Computational methods", "answer_start": 406}], "question": "What is not a way that is used to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a75a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "hydrophilic amino acids", "answer_start": 749}], "question": "What is underrepresented in epitope regions?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a75b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Immunoproteomics", "answer_start": 1257}], "question": "What is the study of small sets of proteins?", "id": "5ad4f3a25b96ef001a10a75c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Larger drugs (>500 Da) can provoke a neutralizing immune response, particularly if the drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses.

In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for Taxol. Computational methods have been developed to predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in epitope regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Drop in the blood levels of cortisol and epinephrine results in increase levels of what hormones?", "id": "572a12386aef051400155234", "answers": [{"text": "leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin", "answer_start": 404}, {"text": "leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin", "answer_start": 404}, {"text": "leptin", "answer_start": 404}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Hormones released during sleep support the interaction of T-cells and what species?", "id": "572a12386aef051400155235", "answers": [{"text": "APCs", "answer_start": 1069}, {"text": "APCs", "answer_start": 1069}, {"text": "APCs", "answer_start": 1069}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Sleep hormones shift the cytokine balance to which cytokine?", "id": "572a12386aef051400155236", "answers": [{"text": "Th1", "answer_start": 1153}, {"text": "one that supports Th1", "answer_start": 1135}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Sleep hormone release supports formation of immune memory by initiating what immune response?", "id": "572a12386aef051400155237", "answers": [{"text": "Th1 immune responses", "answer_start": 1356}, {"text": "Th1", "answer_start": 1356}, {"text": "Th1 immune responses", "answer_start": 1356}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "immunological functions", "answer_start": 159}], "question": "What does sleep have no effect on?", "id": "5ad4eb355b96ef001a10a64c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin", "answer_start": 375}], "question": "What rises during early slow-wave-sleep stage?", "id": "5ad4eb355b96ef001a10a64d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "cytokines", "answer_start": 618}], "question": "What slows down immune functions during sleep?", "id": "5ad4eb355b96ef001a10a64e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin", "answer_start": 987}], "question": "What hormones are produced mostly when awake?", "id": "5ad4eb355b96ef001a10a64f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "APCs and T-cells", "answer_start": 1069}], "question": "What do hormones produced during this time stop from interacting?", "id": "5ad4eb355b96ef001a10a650", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "In addition to the negative consequences of sleep deprivation, sleep and the intertwined circadian system have been shown to have strong regulatory effects on immunological functions affecting both the innate and the adaptive immunity. First, during the early slow-wave-sleep stage, a sudden drop in blood levels of cortisol, epinephrine, and norepinephrine induce increased blood levels of the hormones leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin. These signals induce a pro-inflammatory state through the production of the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin-1, interleukin-12, TNF-alpha and IFN-gamma. These cytokines then stimulate immune functions such as immune cells activation, proliferation, and differentiation. It is during this time that undifferentiated, or less differentiated, like na\u00efve and central memory T cells, peak (i.e. during a time of a slowly evolving adaptive immune response). In addition to these effects, the milieu of hormones produced at this time (leptin, pituitary growth hormone, and prolactin) support the interactions between APCs and T-cells, a shift of the Th1/Th2 cytokine balance towards one that supports Th1, an increase in overall Th cell proliferation, and na\u00efve T cell migration to lymph nodes.

After complement proteins initially bind to the microbe, they activate their protease activity, which in turn activates other complement proteases, and so on.

For example, trial division is a deterministic algorithm because, if performed correctly, it will always identify a prime number as prime and a composite number as composite. Probabilistic algorithms are normally faster, but do not completely prove that a number is prime. These tests rely on testing a given number in a partly random way. For example, a given test might pass all the time if applied to a prime number, but pass only with probability p if applied to a composite number. If we repeat the test n times and pass every time, then the probability that our number is composite is 1/(1-p)n, which decreases exponentially with the number of tests, so we can be as sure as we like (though never perfectly sure) that the number is prime.

If Magicicadas appeared at a non-prime number intervals, say every 12 years, then predators appearing every 2, 3, 4, 6, or 12 years would be sure to meet them. Over a 200-year period, average predator populations during hypothetical outbreaks of 14- and 15-year cicadas would be up to 2% higher than during outbreaks of 13- and 17-year cicadas.

The greatest distinction of an empire is through the amount of land that a nation has conquered and expanded. Political power grew from conquering land, however cultural and economic aspects flourished through sea and trade routes. A distinction about empires is \"that although political empires were built mostly by expansion overland, economic and cultural influences spread at least as much by sea\". Some of the main aspects of trade that went overseas consisted of animals and plant products. European empires in Asia and Africa \"have come to be seen as the classic forms of imperialism: and indeed most books on the subject confine themselves to the European seaborne empires\". European expansion caused the world to be divided by how developed and developing nation are portrayed through the world systems theory. The two main regions are the core and the periphery. The core consists of high areas of income and profit; the periphery is on the opposing side of the spectrum consisting of areas of low income and profit. These critical theories of Geo-politics have led to increased discussion of the meaning and impact of imperialism on the modern post-colonial world. The Russian leader Lenin suggested that \"imperialism was the highest form of capitalism, claiming that imperialism developed after colonialism, and was distinguished from colonialism by monopoly capitalism\". This idea from Lenin stresses how important new political world order has become in our modern era. Geopolitics now focuses on states becoming major economic players in the market; some states today are viewed as empires due to their political and economic authority over other nations."}, {"qas": [{"question": "Imperialism is confused with what other term?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6d", "answers": [{"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 48}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 48}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 48}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 48}, {"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 48}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What does colonialism lack that imperialism has?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6e", "answers": [{"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1222}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1222}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1222}, {"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1222}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 392}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Colonialism as a policy is caused by financial and what other reasons?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce6f", "answers": [{"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 392}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 392}, {"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 392}, {"text": "commercial", "answer_start": 490}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who besides the Russians are often left out of the colonialism debat?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce70", "answers": [{"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1003}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1003}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1003}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1003}, {"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1003}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Imperialism and colonialism both assert a states dominance over what?", "id": "573083dc2461fd1900a9ce71", "answers": [{"text": "person or group of people", "answer_start": 257}, {"text": "a person or group of people", "answer_start": 255}, {"text": "a person or group of people", "answer_start": 255}, {"text": "person or group of people", "answer_start": 257}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "colonialism", "answer_start": 48}], "question": "Imperialism is synonymous with what other term?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a686628", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "political focus", "answer_start": 1222}], "question": " What does colonialism and imperialism share?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a686629", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "ideological", "answer_start": 392}], "question": "Colonialism as a policy is never caused by financial and what other reasons?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Ottoman", "answer_start": 1003}], "question": "Who besides the Russians are often included in the colonialism debat?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "person or group of people", "answer_start": 257}], "question": "Imperialism and colonialism don't assert a states dominance over what?", "id": "5acff5b077cf76001a68662c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The term \"imperialism\" is often conflated with \"colonialism\", however many scholars have argued that each have their own distinct definition. Imperialism and colonialism have been used in order to describe one's superiority, domination and influence upon a person or group of people. Robert Young writes that while imperialism operates from the center, is a state policy and is developed for ideological as well as financial reasons, colonialism is simply the development for settlement or commercial intentions. Colonialism in modern usage also tends to imply a degree of geographic separation between the colony and the imperial power. Particularly, Edward Said distinguishes the difference between imperialism and colonialism by stating; \"imperialism involved 'the practice, the theory and the attitudes of a dominating metropolitan center ruling a distant territory', while colonialism refers to the 'implanting of settlements on a distant territory.' Contiguous land empires such as the Russian or Ottoman are generally excluded from discussions of colonialism.:116 Thus it can be said that imperialism includes some form of colonialism, but colonialism itself does not automatically imply imperialism, as it lacks a political focus.[further explanation needed]"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Political advantage is an attribute of which state policies?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54c", "answers": [{"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}, {"text": "Imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 0}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Colonialism often means a country doing what?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54d", "answers": [{"text": "taking physical control of another", "answer_start": 347}, {"text": "a conquest over an area", "answer_start": 700}, {"text": "the process of a country taking physical control of another", "answer_start": 322}, {"text": "dominating areas", "answer_start": 536}, {"text": "country taking physical control of another", "answer_start": 339}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How would one create an empire by means of Imperialism?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54e", "answers": [{"text": "conquering the other state's lands", "answer_start": 1061}, {"text": "conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance", "answer_start": 1061}, {"text": "by conquering the other state's lands", "answer_start": 1058}, {"text": "political and monetary dominance", "answer_start": 409}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "what do conquering people pass down to native populations?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c54f", "answers": [{"text": "characteristics", "answer_start": 1403}, {"text": "characteristics of the conquering peoples", "answer_start": 1403}, {"text": "characteristics of the conquering peoples", "answer_start": 1403}, {"text": "the characteristics of the conquering peoples", "answer_start": 1399}, {"text": "characteristics", "answer_start": 1403}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is colonialism's core meaning?", "id": "573085ea8ab72b1400f9c550", "answers": [{"text": "exploitation", "answer_start": 845}, {"text": "the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies", "answer_start": 841}, {"text": "the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered", "answer_start": 841}, {"text": "exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits", "answer_start": 845}, {"text": "exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered", "answer_start": 845}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "imperialism and colonialism", "answer_start": 231}], "question": "Political disadvantage is an attribute of which state policies?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "taking physical control of another", "answer_start": 347}], "question": " Colonialism never means a country doing what?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665b", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "conquering the other state's lands", "answer_start": 1061}], "question": " How would one create an empire by means of non-Imperialism?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665c", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "characteristics", "answer_start": 1403}], "question": " what do conquering people take away from native populations?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665d", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "exploitation", "answer_start": 845}], "question": " What is colonialism's antithesis?", "id": "5acff63377cf76001a68665e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Imperialism and colonialism both dictate the political and economic advantage over a land and the indigenous populations they control, yet scholars sometimes find it difficult to illustrate the difference between the two. Although imperialism and colonialism focus on the suppression of an other, if colonialism refers to the process of a country taking physical control of another, imperialism refers to the political and monetary dominance, either formally or informally. Colonialism is seen to be the architect deciding how to start dominating areas and then imperialism can be seen as creating the idea behind conquest cooperating with colonialism. Colonialism is when the imperial nation begins a conquest over an area and then eventually is able to rule over the areas the previous nation had controlled. Colonialism's core meaning is the exploitation of the valuable assets and supplies of the nation that was conquered and the conquering nation then gaining the benefits from the spoils of the war. The meaning of imperialism is to create an empire, by conquering the other state's lands and therefore increasing its own dominance. Colonialism is the builder and preserver of the colonial possessions in an area by a population coming from a foreign region. Colonialism can completely change the existing social structure, physical structure and economics of an area; it is not unusual that the characteristics of the conquering peoples are inherited by the conquered indigenous populations."}, {"qas": [{"question": "what is the most controversial aspect of imperialism?", "id": "5730876a396df9190009617a", "answers": [{"text": "empire-building", "answer_start": 74}, {"text": "defense and justification of empire-building", "answer_start": 45}, {"text": "is the defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds", "answer_start": 38}, {"text": "defense and justification of empire-building based on seemingly rational grounds", "answer_start": 45}, {"text": "defense and justification of empire-building", "answer_start": 45}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": " J.

This difference was particularly apparent in textual and visual works of early European studies of the Orient that positioned the East as irrational and backward in opposition to the rational and progressive West. Defining the East as a negative vision of itself, as its inferior, not only increased the West\u2019s sense of self, but also was a way of ordering the East and making it known to the West so that it could be dominated and controlled.

The term \"Imperialism\" was originally introduced into English in its present sense in the late 1870s by opponents of the allegedly aggressive and ostentatious imperial policies of British prime Minister Benjamin Disraeli. It was shortly appropriated by supporters of \"imperialism\" such as Joseph Chamberlain. For some, imperialism designated a policy of idealism and philanthropy; others alleged that it was characterized by political self-interest, and a growing number associated it with capitalist greed. Liberal John A. Hobson and Marxist Vladimir Lenin added a more theoretical macroeconomic connotation to the term. Lenin in particular exerted substantial influence over later Marxist conceptions of imperialism with his work Imperialism, the Highest Stage of Capitalism. In his writings Lenin portrayed Imperialism as a natural extension of capitalism that arose from need for capitalist economies to constantly expand investment, material resources and manpower in such a way that necessitated colonial expansion. This conception of imperialism as a structural feature of capitalism is echoed by later Marxist theoreticians. Many theoreticians on the left have followed in emphasizing the structural or systemic character of \"imperialism\". Such writers have expanded the time period associated with the term so that it now designates neither a policy, nor a short space of decades in the late 19th century, but a world system extending over a period of centuries, often going back to Christopher Columbus and, in some accounts, to the Crusades. As the application of the term has expanded, its meaning has shifted along five distinct but often parallel axes: the moral, the economic, the systemic, the cultural, and the temporal. Those changes reflect - among other shifts in sensibility - a growing unease, even squeamishness, with the fact of power, specifically, Western power."}, {"qas": [{"question": "some debate that there is a correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c600", "answers": [{"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}, {"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When were Joseph Schumpeter and Norman Angell at their most prolific writing period?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c601", "answers": [{"text": "before World War I", "answer_start": 361}, {"text": "World War I", "answer_start": 368}, {"text": "before World War I", "answer_start": 361}, {"text": "before World War I", "answer_start": 361}, {"text": "before World War I,", "answer_start": 361}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "When was the military-political complex reflected upon within the scope of understanding imperialism?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c602", "answers": [{"text": "the 1950s", "answer_start": 616}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}, {"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Hobson argued that imperialism was an international what?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c603", "answers": [{"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}, {"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How did Hobson argue to rid the world of imperialism?", "id": "57309ef18ab72b1400f9c604", "answers": [{"text": "taxation", "answer_start": 808}, {"text": "removing its economic foundation", "answer_start": 725}, {"text": "domestic social reforms", "answer_start": 646}, {"text": "removing its economic foundation", "answer_start": 725}, {"text": "removing its economic foundation.", "answer_start": 725}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "aristocracy", "answer_start": 36}], "question": "There is some debate that there is a not correlation between capitalism, imperialism, and what?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d8e", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "before World War I,", "answer_start": 361}], "question": " When weren't Joseph Schumpeter and Norman Angell at their most prolific writing period?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d8f", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "1950s", "answer_start": 620}], "question": " When was the military-political complex reflected upon not within the scope of understanding imperialism?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d90", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "disease", "answer_start": 699}], "question": " Hobson argued that imperialism wasn't an international what?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d91", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "taxation", "answer_start": 808}], "question": " How did Hobson argue to not rid the world of imperialism?", "id": "5ad02fda77cf76001a686d92", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The correlation between capitalism, aristocracy, and imperialism has long been debated among historians and political theorists.

After the Third Partition of Poland in 1795, Warsaw was incorporated into the Kingdom of Prussia. In 1806 during the Napoleonic Wars, the city became the official capital of the Grand Duchy of Warsaw, a puppet state of the First French Empire established by Napoleon Bonaparte. In accordance with the decisions of the Congress of Vienna, the Russian Empire annexed Warsaw in 1815 and it became part of the \"Congress Kingdom\". Only in 1918 did it regain independence from the foreign rule and emerge as a new capital of the independent Republic of Poland. The German invasion in 1939, the massacre of the Jewish population and deportations to concentration camps led to the uprising in the Warsaw ghetto in 1943 and to the major and devastating Warsaw Uprising between August and October 1944. Warsaw gained the title of the \"Phoenix City\" because it has survived many wars, conflicts and invasions throughout its long history. Most notably, the city required painstaking rebuilding after the extensive damage it suffered in World War II, which destroyed 85% of its buildings. On 9 November 1940, the city was awarded Poland's highest military decoration for heroism, the Virtuti Militari, during the Siege of Warsaw (1939)."}, {"qas": [{"question": "What archdiocese is Warsaw the seat of?", "id": "573314e3d058e614000b56f0", "answers": [{"text": "Roman Catholic", "answer_start": 26}, {"text": "Roman Catholic", "answer_start": 26}, {"text": "Roman Catholic", "answer_start": 26}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is another notable university in Warsaw after the University of Warsaw?", "id": "573314e3d058e614000b56f1", "answers": [{"text": "Polish Academy of Sciences", "answer_start": 159}, {"text": "Polish Academy of Sciences", "answer_start": 159}, {"text": "Polish Academy of Sciences", "answer_start": 159}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What was Warsaw's Old Town listed as in 1980?", "id": "573314e3d058e614000b56f2", "answers": [{"text": "a UNESCO World Heritage Site", "answer_start": 365}, {"text": "UNESCO World Heritage Site", "answer_start": 367}, {"text": "UNESCO World Heritage Site", "answer_start": 367}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "King Sigimund's Column is an example of what kind of attraction in Warsaw?", "id": "573314e3d058e614000b56f3", "answers": [{"text": "architectural", "answer_start": 406}, {"text": "architectural", "answer_start": 406}, {"text": "architectural", "answer_start": 406}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is a quarter of Warsaw filled with?", "id": "573314e3d058e614000b56f4", "answers": [{"text": "luxurious parks and royal gardens", "answer_start": 905}, {"text": "luxurious parks and royal gardens", "answer_start": 905}, {"text": "luxurious parks and royal gardens", "answer_start": 905}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Roman Catholic", "answer_start": 26}], "question": "What archdiocese is Market Square the seat of?", "id": "5ad510be5b96ef001a10ab56", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "a UNESCO World Heritage Site", "answer_start": 365}], "question": "What was Warsaw's Market Square listed as in 1980?", "id": "5ad510be5b96ef001a10ab57", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "luxurious parks and royal gardens", "answer_start": 905}], "question": "What is a quarter of UNESCO filled with?", "id": "5ad510be5b96ef001a10ab58", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Polish Academy of Sciences", "answer_start": 159}], "question": "What is another notable university in UNESCO after the University of Warsaw?", "id": "5ad510be5b96ef001a10ab59", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "architectural", "answer_start": 704}], "question": "King Sigimund's Column is an example of what kind of attraction in UNESCO?", "id": "5ad510be5b96ef001a10ab5a", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "The city is the seat of a Roman Catholic archdiocese (left bank of the Vistula) and diocese (right bank), and possesses various universities, most notably the Polish Academy of Sciences and the University of Warsaw, two opera houses, theatres, museums, libraries and monuments.

A fundamental error was the belief that a force is required to maintain motion, even at a constant velocity. Most of the previous misunderstandings about motion and force were eventually corrected by Galileo Galilei and Sir Isaac Newton. With his mathematical insight, Sir Isaac Newton formulated laws of motion that were not improved-on for nearly three hundred years.

He distinguished between the innate tendency of objects to find their \"natural place\" (e.g., for heavy bodies to fall), which led to \"natural motion\", and unnatural or forced motion, which required continued application of a force. This theory, based on the everyday experience of how objects move, such as the constant application of a force needed to keep a cart moving, had conceptual trouble accounting for the behavior of projectiles, such as the flight of arrows. The place where the archer moves the projectile was at the start of the flight, and while the projectile sailed through the air, no discernible efficient cause acts on it.

Alternatively, if an external force acts on the system, then the center of mass will experience an acceleration proportional to the magnitude of the external force divided by the mass of the system.:19-1"}, {"qas": [{"question": "What does pushing and pulling perceptions provide for describing forces?", "id": "573766251c45671900574471", "answers": [{"text": "intuitive understanding", "answer_start": 67}, {"text": "an intuitive understanding", "answer_start": 64}, {"text": "an intuitive understanding", "answer_start": 64}, {"text": "intuitive understanding", "answer_start": 67}, {"text": "an intuitive understanding", "answer_start": 64}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is used to quantify the intuitive undestanding of forces?", "id": "573766251c45671900574472", "answers": [{"text": "standard measurement scale", "answer_start": 319}, {"text": "precise operational definitions", "answer_start": 224}, {"text": "precise operational definitions", "answer_start": 224}, {"text": "precise operational definitions", "answer_start": 224}, {"text": "precise operational definitions", "answer_start": 224}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What offers a conceptual definition of force?", "id": "573766251c45671900574473", "answers": [{"text": "Newtonian mechanics", "answer_start": 500}, {"text": "Newtonian mechanics", "answer_start": 500}, {"text": "Newtonian mechanics", "answer_start": 500}, {"text": "Newtonian mechanics", "answer_start": 500}, {"text": "Newtonian mechanics", "answer_start": 500}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How are laboratory measurements of forces determined?", "id": "573766251c45671900574474", "answers": [{"text": "experimentation", "answer_start": 355}, {"text": "Through experimentation", "answer_start": 347}, {"text": "Through experimentation", "answer_start": 347}, {"text": "Through experimentation", "answer_start": 347}, {"text": "experimentation", "answer_start": 355}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "conceptual definition of force offered by Newtonian mechanics", "answer_start": 458}], "question": "Laboratory measurements of forces are fully inconsistent with what?", "id": "5ad26797d7d075001a429236", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "Newtonian mechanics", "answer_start": 500}], "question": "The conceptual definition of pushes and pulls are offered by what?", "id": "5ad26797d7d075001a429237", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "force", "answer_start": 483}], "question": "Newtonian mechanisms are the definition of what?", "id": "5ad26797d7d075001a429238", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "temperature", "answer_start": 152}], "question": "What is an example of a metaphysical concept?", "id": "5ad26797d7d075001a429239", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "Since forces are perceived as pushes or pulls, this can provide an intuitive understanding for describing forces.

The two people could be pulling against each other as in tug of war or the two people could be pulling in the same direction.

Resolving force vectors into components of a set of basis vectors is often a more mathematically clean way to describe forces than using magnitudes and directions. This is because, for orthogonal components, the components of the vector sum are uniquely determined by the scalar addition of the components of the individual vectors. Orthogonal components are independent of each other because forces acting at ninety degrees to each other have no effect on the magnitude or direction of the other. Choosing a set of orthogonal basis vectors is often done by considering what set of basis vectors will make the mathematics most convenient. Choosing a basis vector that is in the same direction as one of the forces is desirable, since that force would then have only one non-zero component.

Galileo concluded that motion in a constant velocity was completely equivalent to rest. This was contrary to Aristotle's notion of a \"natural state\" of rest that objects with mass naturally approached. Simple experiments showed that Galileo's understanding of the equivalence of constant velocity and rest were correct. For example, if a mariner dropped a cannonball from the crow's nest of a ship moving at a constant velocity, Aristotelian physics would have the cannonball fall straight down while the ship moved beneath it. Thus, in an Aristotelian universe, the falling cannonball would land behind the foot of the mast of a moving ship. However, when this experiment is actually conducted, the cannonball always falls at the foot of the mast, as if the cannonball knows to travel with the ship despite being separated from it. Since there is no forward horizontal force being applied on the cannonball as it falls, the only conclusion left is that the cannonball continues to move with the same velocity as the boat as it falls.

This description applies to all forces arising from fundamental interactions. While sophisticated mathematical descriptions are needed to predict, in full detail, the accurate result of such interactions, there is a conceptually simple way to describe such interactions through the use of Feynman diagrams. In a Feynman diagram, each matter particle is represented as a straight line (see world line) traveling through time, which normally increases up or to the right in the diagram. Matter and anti-matter particles are identical except for their direction of propagation through the Feynman diagram. World lines of particles intersect at interaction vertices, and the Feynman diagram represents any force arising from an interaction as occurring at the vertex with an associated instantaneous change in the direction of the particle world lines.

This standard model of particle physics posits a similarity between the forces and led scientists to predict the unification of the weak and electromagnetic forces in electroweak theory subsequently confirmed by observation. The complete formulation of the standard model predicts an as yet unobserved Higgs mechanism, but observations such as neutrino oscillations indicate that the standard model is incomplete. A Grand Unified Theory allowing for the combination of the electroweak interaction with the strong force is held out as a possibility with candidate theories such as supersymmetry proposed to accommodate some of the outstanding unsolved problems in physics. Physicists are still attempting to develop self-consistent unification models that would combine all four fundamental interactions into a theory of everything. Einstein tried and failed at this endeavor, but currently the most popular approach to answering this question is string theory.:212\u2013219"}, {"qas": [{"question": "Who identified gravity as a force?", "id": "573784fa1c45671900574483", "answers": [{"text": "Isaac Newton", "answer_start": 83}, {"text": "Isaac Newton", "answer_start": 83}, {"text": "Isaac Newton", "answer_start": 83}, {"text": "Isaac Newton", "answer_start": 83}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Who came up with the concept that falling objects fell at the same speed regardless of weight?", "id": "573784fa1c45671900574484", "answers": [{"text": "Galileo", "answer_start": 233}, {"text": "Galileo", "answer_start": 233}, {"text": "Galileo", "answer_start": 233}, {"text": "Galileo", "answer_start": 233}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "How fast do objects fall on Earth?", "id": "573784fa1c45671900574485", "answers": [{"text": "about 9.81 meters per second squared", "answer_start": 555}, {"text": "about 9.81 meters per second squared", "answer_start": 555}, {"text": "about 9.81 meters per second", "answer_start": 555}, {"text": "9.81 meters per second", "answer_start": 561}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "Where was the measurment for the standard gravity on Earth taken?", "id": "573784fa1c45671900574486", "answers": [{"text": "sea level", "answer_start": 624}, {"text": "sea level", "answer_start": 624}, {"text": "sea level", "answer_start": 624}, {"text": "from sea level", "answer_start": 619}], "is_impossible": false}, {"question": "What is an object's mass proportional to at the surface of the Earth?", "id": "573784fa1c45671900574487", "answers": [{"text": "force of gravity", "answer_start": 746}, {"text": "the force of gravity on an object", "answer_start": 742}, {"text": "force of gravity", "answer_start": 746}, {"text": "force of gravity", "answer_start": 746}], "is_impossible": false}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "gravity", "answer_start": 17}], "question": "Until the work of Galileo, what was not identified as a universal force?", "id": "5ad27a80d7d075001a4295fa", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "objects", "answer_start": 303}], "question": "Newton was instrumental in describing the characteristics of falling what?", "id": "5ad27a80d7d075001a4295fb", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "acceleration due to gravity towards the surface of the Earth", "answer_start": 445}], "question": "What has a magnitude of about 8.81 meters per second squared?", "id": "5ad27a80d7d075001a4295fc", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}, {"plausible_answers": [{"text": "gravity", "answer_start": 17}], "question": "What was identified as a universal force after the work of Galileo?", "id": "5ad27a80d7d075001a4295fd", "answers": [], "is_impossible": true}], "context": "What we now call gravity was not identified as a universal force until the work of Isaac Newton.
